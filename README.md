This App is a social media app that allows young developers to share their projects in a Facebook style platform.
It is built on the Firebase platform, to maintain a growing userbase as well as to handle security.
Login is handled in 2 ways:
1: Email address Login
2: Facebook Login

I have used Google's Material Design for the UI. 

Future improvments: 

1. Adding a project suggestion section.
2. Chat Functionality
3. User Collaboration and RoadMap. - Allows other users to collaborate with the original developer and create a road map on progress.
